# Data Scientist Nanodegree Term 2 Project
### Writing a blog post: Airbnb Data

In this repo you'll find the analysis I did for the data scientist nanodegree, in particular I dove into some publicly available data from Airbnb and tried to answer the following questions:

1. What is the distribution of Airbnb prices?
1. What are the top contributing features?
1. Does the set of high value features change looking at different cities?
1. Could we use this analysis to help people make their Airbnb rentals more attractive?

In general I found that the most important features were location and size of the Airbnb, and that didn't vary too much from city to city.

## Requirements
`pandas`

`numpy`

`matplotlib`

`seaborn`

`scikit-learn`

`jupyter` if running locally

## Files in the repo
- `Airbnb Data Investigation.ipynb` - contains the analysis
- `boston-airbnb-open-data/calendar.csv` `listings.csv` `reviews.csv` - Boston data
- `seattle/calendar.csv listings.csv` `reviews.csv` - Seattle data
